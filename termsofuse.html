March.Company may also offer products and services for purchase via credit card or other payment processors on the Website or inside the App (&ldquo;Internal Purchases&rdquo;).

If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period, at which point it will expire.<br /> <br /> Because our Services may be utilized without a subscription, canceling your subscription does not remove your profile from our Services. If you wish to fully terminate your membership, you must terminate your membership as set forth in Section 9.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>8a. EXTERNAL SERVICE PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When making a purchase on the Service, you may have the option to pay through an External Service, such as with your Apple ID or Google account (&ldquo;your External Service Account&rdquo;), and your External Service Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to your External Service Account. Some External Services may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live, which may change from time to time.<br /> <br /> If your External Service Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your External Service Account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing.<br /> <br /> To cancel a subscription: If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your External Service Account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the App from your device.<br /> <br /> For example, if you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not March.Company. To cancel a purchase made with your Apple ID, go to Settings &gt; iTunes &amp; App Stores &gt; [click on your Apple ID] &gt; View Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions, then find your March.Company subscription and follow the instructions to cancel.

The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.<br /> <br /> If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your External Service Account, March.Company may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion, on the basis that you have determined that you do not want a March.Company subscription.

March.Company may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if we have already requested or received payment.

The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.<br /> <br /> You may edit your Payment Method information by using the Settings tool. If a payment is not successfully processed, due to expiration or otherwise, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.<br /> <br /> In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer, or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. Certain users may be entitled to request a refund. See Section 8d below for more information.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><strong>8d. REFUNDS</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The purchase and sale of the subscriptions is a completed transaction upon receipt of your payment. You can cancel the subscription within 3 working days upon payment to any of the services offered and receive a full refund into your bank account/credit card, provided you have not used the subscription in any manner after the payment. Use of the subscription or service means sending to or receiving from other members and any communication, viewing profiles of other members, or making changes to your profile or information on your account. If the subscription is used after payment, you will lose your refund/cancellation right. When you meet the criteria for refunds, refunds will be issued immediately from our end, however, some banks take 5-15 days to process the refund and reflect the same in your bank/card statement.<br /> <br /> Your ability to use any subscription is effective immediately once they are placed in your account. If you choose to not use the subscription to its fullest extent, and let subscription expire, you may do so. Any subscription shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead only constitutes a measurement of the extent of your subscription. We may redeem any unused subscription for you promptly after their expiration date if we choose.
